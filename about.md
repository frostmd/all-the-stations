## About

All The Stations - Irleand, is a project for Geoff and Vicki to travel to ALL the railway stations in Ireland and Northern Ireland in three weeks - there's 198 stations in total - creating Online videos as they go to document the journey.

In the Summer of 2017, the successfully did this with the original 'All The Stations' where they travelled to all 2,563 railways stations in Great Britain [and the 3 new ones since], creating a 59 video (with over 4 million views) of their journey as well as a feature length documentary upon their return.

This latest project once again aims to capture the current status of railways in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and bring them to life over three weeks as we explore the reality of the places and people we encounter along the way.

Through film and social media we want to share the whole experience with you, and for your thoughts and ideas to contribute to the journey and the stories we tell.

- Almost everyday we'll post a professionally edited video to Youtube that documents the journey and brings you closer to the experience.
- Every day we’ll be sharing our travels using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Live streams, photos and updates will keep you in touch between the videos.

### How can you follow along?

During our time on the rails we will:

•	Post professionally edited videos on YouTube that document the journey and bring you closer to the experience. There will be one video created for each day we spend travelling on the rails.
•	Keep you in touch with our daily progress using Facebook Live, Twitter and photographs on Instagram - all as it happens.

### Why is this project important?

Throughout our project in Great Britain, we discovered that the railways mean different things to different people. For some they provide vital links for jobs, education and well-being. They can connect different communities, forge friendships and open up new opportunities. For others, they are a cause of frustration, or simply a necessary hurdle to overcome in their day to day lives.

But is this the same everywhere? How do the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland feel about their railways? What challenges do they face, what are the highlights, how quaint are the stations, what historical and cultural stories can you connect to and where can you get the best buffet cuppa?

And how do the railways themselves operate? Will we still find manually operated gates and semaphore signals in use? Is there seamless interoperability between services in Ireland and Northern Ireland? What happens after the UK leaves the EU, how will this impact passenger journeys across the Irish border?

We aim to answer all these questions, sharing the entire story with you along the way, to capture a unique moment in European transport history. 

### What counts as having visited each station?

1. There are 144 stations on the Iarnród Éireann network and 54 stations on Northern Ireland Railways, giving us a total of 198 stations to visit.
2. The stations along the Luas tram system in Dublin do not count towards the official stations total. However, because we surpassed our original Kickstarter funding goal, we now have capacity to travel along it and make a bonus video about the system. 
3. We will not be including any disused sections on the network (e.g the Waterford to Rosslare line) where the track and stations are still in place but services no longer run.

More of your questions are answered over on the Kickstarter page <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/562621903/all-the-stations/faqs" target="new">in the FAQ section</a>, have a read!

And finally, it’s not a race to do this in the fastest time possible, it’s a team effort between two people to cover all the stations, with the cameras rolling.

## Crowd Funding

Our journey began in May 2017 and has been made possible through overwhelming public support. We launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/562621903/all-the-stations" target="new">a Kickstarter campaign in February</a> and in just ten days reached our initial target of £28,825. The campaign closed on 27 March having achieved a staggering *£38,654*. Such a generous total allows us to produce more rich and engaging video content for the public.
