### About

All The Stations is a project led by Geoff Marshall and Vicki Pipe and crowdfunded by over 1,500 members of the public. During the spring and summer of 2017 we travelled to ALL the national railway stations in Britain in just three and a half months (14 weeks, 6 days and 22 minutes to be precise). We filmed the journey as we went and with the support of an incredible team were able to; 

- Produce four professionally edited videos each week that documented four separate days of the journey bringing our followers closer to the experience.
- Share the journey using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Live streams, photos and updates kept everyone in touch between the videos.

Since the end of the journey we have been working on the production of a feature length documentary, due for online release in 2018, which will include additional footage and insights into the project. 

Whilst the journey is over, the legacy of All The Stations continues. Our aim is to capture the current status of Britain’s railways, bringing them and the reality of the places and people the railways serve to life for everyone to enjoy and share.



### Why is this project important?

Within the next decade, changes to the rail network will be more pivotal than ever, and we want to capture this critical moment in Britain's rail history, producing a snapshot of today's railways for posterity.

To ensure the project becomes an asset for the future we are in conversations with the <a href="http://www.nrm.org.uk/" target="new">National Railway Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/" target="new">London Transport Museum</a> and hope to donate all relevant material to their collections.

<em>We would like to thank the <a href="http://www.raildeliverygroup.com/" target="new">Rail Delivery Group</a> for their endorsement and generous support of the project. The RDG is a body that represents the 23 train operating companies that make up the British railway system.</em>

### Project Rules

Before setting out on the journey we clearly defined the parameters of the project. 

### What counts as a station?

1. At the time of planning we used the most up-to-date list of stations in Great Britain <a href="http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates" target="new">provided by the Office of Rail and Road</a> (ORR). The list for 2015-16 contained 2,557 stations. When we set out on the journey five new stations had opened, bringing the total to 2,563.
    {% assign site_unix_time = site.time | date: '%s' | plus: 0 %}
    {% if site_unix_time < 1495321200 %} 
    
    <a href="/stationlist">The complete station list is available here</a>.
2. The London Underground, Tyne &amp; Wear Metro, Glasgow Subway, heritage railways and stations in Northern Ireland were **not** included, and neither were abandoned stations (e.g. Norton Bridge, Newhaven Marine).

### What counts as having visited each station?

1. We **had** to arrive or leave on a scheduled train that was timetabled to stop at each station - fast trains that passed through did not count.
2. We **didn’t** have to leave the train at every station, but we did get off at some of the most interesting stations to capture footage of the surrounding area. 
3. Request stops had a special rule. As long as the train we were on was able to stop, if requested, then we counted it as having been visited, even if no one actually got on or off.
4. It **wasn't** a race to do this in the fastest time possible, it was a team effort between two people to cover all the stations, with the cameras rolling.

### Crowd Funding

Our journey began in May 2017 and was made possible through overwhelming public support. We launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/562621903/all-the-stations" target="new">a Kickstarter campaign in February</a> and in just ten days reached our initial target of £28,825. The campaign closed on 27 March having achieved a staggering *£38,654*. Such a generous total allowed us to produce more rich and engaging video content for the public.
