			<p>We aim to start our journey in May 2017, but to make this project happen we need your support!</p>
			<p>Please see our Kickstarter page and pledge a donation to help us raise funds to cover the cost of:</p>

			<ul>
			  <li>Editing and graphic production (to ensure videos are high quality)</li>
				<li>Accommodation and food expenses whilst on the rails (in places where we don’t have a couch to crash on)</li>
				<li>Web and media support (live information will be fed back to our website every day)</li>
				<li>Equipment (suitable for filming on the go)</li>
				<li>Admin costs (to keep us in the loop whilst travelling so that we don’t miss anything really important)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In return for your support we are offering many great rewards including postcards sent during the trip, as well as  joining us for part of the journey. Details of all the rewards are on the Kickstarter page.</p>
			<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></p>
			<p>The more money we raise, the bigger and better we can make the project. Thanks to your pledges we have reached our initial target and our first stretch goal, which brings you a guaranteed three professionally edited videos per week for the duration of the journey.</p>
			<p>We're now targetting to reach our <em>second</em> stretch goal which will allow us to make you <strong>four</strong> professionally edited videos per week. The target is a big one ... it's <strong>£37,225</strong>.</p>
