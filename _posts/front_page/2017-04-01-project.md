			<p><strong><em>We've made our funding target and stretch goals!</em></strong></p>
			<p>Geoff is a freelance video editor and transport vlogger, Vicki is a museum education professional. Our transport videos already published online have accumulated over <em>6 million views </em>on Youtube, but in this latest project the aim is to capture the current status of Britain’s railways, and bring them to life as we explore the reality of the places and people we encounter along the way.</p>

			<p>Through social media we want to share the whole experience with you, and for your thoughts and ideas to contribute to the journey and the stories we tell</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Each week we’ll post professionally edited videos that document the journey and bring you closer to the experience.</li>
			  <li>Every day we’ll be keeping you in touch with our travels using Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</li>
			  <li>At the end of the journey we’ll produce a feature length documentary, which will include additional footage and insights into the project.</li>
		    </ul>
			<h3>Why is this project important?</h3>
			<p>Within the next decade, changes to the rail network will be more pivotal than ever, and we want to capture this critical moment in Britain's rail history, producing a snapshot of today's railways for posterity.</p>
			<p>To ensure the project becomes an asset for the future we have begun conversations with the <a href="http://www.nrm.org.uk/" target="new">National Railway Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/" target="new">London Transport Museum</a> and hope to donate all relevant material to their collections.</p>

			<p><em>We would like to thank the <a href="http://www.raildeliverygroup.com/" target="new">Rail Delivery Group</a> for their endorsement and generous support of the project. The RDG is a body that represents the 23 train operating companies that make up the British railway system.</em></p>
