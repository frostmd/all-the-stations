			<p>Vicki is a museum education professional by trade, but also an artist and performer and often finds these three things join together nicely. Her interest in railways lays with the stories of people, social change and how the railways impact on our sense of space and surroundings. If asked  what her favourite train stock was, she'd likely say 'Hogwarts Express'. </p>
