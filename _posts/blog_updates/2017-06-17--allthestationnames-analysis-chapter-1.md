Having had a keen interest in Railways since I was head-high to a buffer stop, seldom did I really take notice of station names.  Sure, the ones on my local line in Berkshire I could reel off along with all the big stations around the country, but since the start of this project I have taken a greater interest in the stations that most people would never had heard of or travelled anywhere near.  I have been asked by the All The Stations team to put together some interesting stats on #allthestationnames.

*DISCLAIMER:  All station name data has been taken from the ORR Estimates of Station Usage document and double-checked with the National Rail Enquiries Station Search for any anomalies (which there were a few!).  If you spot something incorrect, contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanLoudShirts).*

## **A River Runs Through it …**

There are five stations with the word THAMES in them, only three of which are proper towns.

**The List**

Proper ones - Henley-On-Thames (this really IS ‘on Thames’ - the river is only about 150 yards from the buffer stops), Thames Ditton, Walton-On-Thames

The Thameslink Two - City Thameslink, West Hampstead Thameslink

## **“Geoff? Bridges!”**

There are 64 stations with the word BRIDGE in the name.  65 if you count the station name of BRIDGWATER (why did they drop the ‘e’?). Only 31 of these actually feature BRIDGE as a separate word.  Only two have BRIDGE as the first word, both in Scotland.  One station not on the list is NORTON BRIDGE, although the station is not technically closed, no trains call there.

## **No Catastrophes With Apostrophes!**

There are a total of 28 stations featuring an apostrophe and one that features TWO!  Not only that, it also features two hyphens!  The quaintly-named HALL-I'-TH'-WOOD STATION (HID) in Lancashire on the line between Manchester Victoria and Clitheroe.
