title: A love affair with the London Overground

When asked to think about ‘Great British Railway Journeys’, you might conjure up images of the rolling hills by the Conwy Valley line or the Kyle of Lochalsh line in the dramatic Scottish Highlands. And while these certainly are scenically stunning, there is still much to celebrate about certain inner-city, suburban lines too. 

One case in point, is the London Overground. Officially launched in 2007 with further extensions between 2010-2011, it is believed that more than 189 million people used the Overground in 2016/2017. The line is a success story. Comfortable, spacious and most importantly **useful**, it shows just how good a railway can be with the right investment. 

With trains roughly every 10-15 minutes, we found that the line has become an integral part of the capital’s transport landscape and was constantly being used throughout the day. On and off-peak, Londoners love the Overground. And we do too. 

Take a look at [our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWoYafg0z8E) from the day we circuited the London Overgound, for more reasons on why it might just be one of our favourites.
