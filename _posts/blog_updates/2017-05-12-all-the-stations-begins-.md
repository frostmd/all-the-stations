We've begun our round-Britain challenge to visit All The Stations! We set off from Penzance station this morning with our rucksacks packed and our shiny new All Line Rover tickets, ready to tackle the line to St Ives.

St Ives was just far too beautiful! Set on an idyllic coast line, with a great winding cobbled street, it was everything we'd hoped for and more. We loved the town, despite the seagulls, and we're already making plans to come back one day.

On the way back to Penzance we stopped off at Lelant Saltings, and tiny Lelant - the first of many request stops along our journey - and thankfully the driver stopped when we flagged him down! Here's the [video of our Day 1 adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoA1OTQJoxQ).

Thanks for following along,

Geoff and Vicki
