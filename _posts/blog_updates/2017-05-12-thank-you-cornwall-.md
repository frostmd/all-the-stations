On our third day we've crossed the Tamar Bridge to enter Devon, and Cornwall becomes the first county where we've visited All The Stations. Yesterday we rode the branch lines to Newquay and Falmouth... where we made sure we found time to climb the rock overlooking the harbour to visit Pendennis Castle.

Today we took the single track branch line to Looe, where Vicki was surprised to see some mechanics behind the driver changing the points, and Geoff decided that tiny Coombe Junction Halt is his favourite station _ever_.

With the line to Gunnislake also ticked off, that's the whole of Cornwall under our belts! It's been fascinating to see how the landscape changes so quickly from one region to another; rolling hills, meadows with overgrown hedgerows, urban industry, harbours and seas!

You can enjoy listening to our interview with Radio Cornwall [here](http://allthestations.co.uk/static/CoastFM-2017-05-08.mp3), and watch our [Cornwall video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hHaF1RXSl0).

To the trains!

Geoff and Vicki
