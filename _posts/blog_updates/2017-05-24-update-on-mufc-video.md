We made a rail journey to Manchester United Halt station on Sunday 21st May, and thoroughly enjoyed our time in this great city.
Due to the devastating events which took place on Monday evening at the Manchester Arena, close to Manchester Victoria Station, we will be postponing the release of the video of this trip until next week.

A further bonus video on the Manchester Trams will also now be published next week.

There are a number of charity pages which have been set up to support the families and friends of those affected including:

**Manchester Evening News:** http://bit.ly/ats2qbN6oz
**British Red Cross:** http://bit.ly/ats2rzAgAu

Our thoughts are with all those affected.
