importance of PA announcements. 
But nowhere has the ‘language’ of railways been so apparent as in Wales this week, our first ‘bi-lingual’ stretch of the
journey where the vast majority of all signage is in both English and Welsh. 
Armed with a guide to Welsh station names and pronunciation (thank you, Alex!) we’ve done our best to absorb this
