Something we would like to talk about further along in the journey is how the railways utilise branding, and how effective that is in making their passengers ‘feel’ a certain way. 

Already we’ve noticed how swapping between train operating companies can take you from the familiar to the unfamiliar. Some remind us of work, some of holidays, while others are new territory altogether!

But, more on that later. In the meantime we wanted to share some signage from our earlier visit to the Island Line on the Isle of Wight. How do these signs make you feel? For us, they have a certain identity. A ye olde feel, a particular aesthetic, which makes us think of family holidays and ice creams at the seaside (trying to avoid the word ‘quaint’ here!).

We love that signs, railway or not, can evoke certain feelings and memories in us all. We hope to write more on this as we continue to make our way around the country.
