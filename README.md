The All the Stations main site.

## Technical notes

### Blogging
New blog posts can be created by cloning the Jekyll template in /_posts/blog_updates or by using the Netlify CMS (you'll need a Github account with permissions to this repo): http://inspector-dolly-24010.netlify.com/admin/

### Where the content is hosted
- //allthestations.co.uk points to the gh-pages site
- //www.allthestations.co.uk point to the traditional host

This rather odd setup is as we couldn't use a cname in the normal way with the host.
